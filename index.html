        <p class="description">
            70,000 years ago, the Wisconsin Ice Sheet settled over the area that is today New York City. A thousand feet deep, the glacier deposited massive 
            ammounts of gravel, pebbles, and sand at its edge.

            From southern Staten Island to its terminus in northern Nassau County, this geologic feature is known as the Ronkonkoma Morraine. It has given the city the hills of 
            Greenwood Cemetery, the neighborhood names of places like Crown Heights, and the high ground on which to build amenities like the Ridgewood Reservoir.
        </p>    
        <p class="description">
            In other parts of the city, the glacier scraped, polished, and deformed boulders. It shaped valleys and lifted hills. The city lives in this legacy. We 
            navigate a ground formed tens of thousands of years ago.
